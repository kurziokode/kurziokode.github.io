            </h2>

            <div class="main-text plan multi-column">
                <p>Sometimes, Internet users θα ηθελα land themselves in an uncommon situation where an app or website
                    can be used for both work and personal situations. Well, a young front-end designer was spending up
                    to 13 hours on the site, Codepen for work and her hobby, which unfortunately, is also coding. </p>
                <p>The designer, whose work includes a <em>To-Do Terrarium</em>, clarified, "Well, I didn't <em> have
                    </em>to use it for work but it was already part of my workflow. It just made sense as it was more
                    efficient." The biggest issue, she said, is that she would hop on Codepen for work, but would get
                    distracted by pens made by others in the community for unexpectedly long periods of time, which then
                    causes her to spend even more time on the site.</p>
                <p> "I mean, that's terrible right?" she asked. Codepen, which brands itself as the best place to build,
                    test, and discover front-end code, has declined to comment at this time.</p>
